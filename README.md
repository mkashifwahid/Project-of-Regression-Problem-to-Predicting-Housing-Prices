# Project-of-Regression-Problem-to-Predicting-Housing-Prices

In this project you will discover how to develop and evaluate neural network models using Keras for a regression problem Step by Step

After completing this step-by-step project, you will know:

•	How to load a CSV dataset and make it available to Keras.

•	How to create a neural network model with Keras for a regression problem.

•	How to use scikit-learn with Keras to evaluate models using cross-validation.

•	How to perform data preparation in order to improve skill with Keras models.

•	How to tune the network topology of models with Keras.
